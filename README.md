# The Gold Tree

The Gold Tree is an Information System for Analyzing Academic Genealogy 

Academic genealogy investigates the relationships between student researchers
and academy professionals. In recent years, it proved to be a powerful
technique to help analyze the spread of scientific knowledge. Tools that make
to visualize these relationships among academics easier are potentially useful
and have been proposed. This work specifies and describes the development of a
Web information system for creating and visualizing academic genealogy trees
from a set of metadata extracted and integrated from multiple sources. The
proposed system allows a researcher to query and track information about his
or her advisers and graduate students at any level. A case study was explored
to validate the system using data from more than 570 thousand theses and
dissertations. The project was developed in the Information Management
Research Group (GINFO) of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG) and
was partially funded by the FAPERGS.
